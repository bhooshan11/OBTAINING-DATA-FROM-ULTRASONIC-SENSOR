# TASK 6 : OBTAINING DATA FROM ULTRASONIC SENSOR

**Ultrasonic sensor :**- The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor uses sonar to detect an object. This sensor can read from 2cm to 400cm with an accuracy of 0.3cm. the ultrasonic sensor emits a high frequency sound and this frequency travels through the air when it finds an object it gets reflected and this reflected frequency is received by the receiver. Considering the time taken to reflect the distance of object is calculated using the formula 

Distance of object= ((speed of sound in air) *time)/2
